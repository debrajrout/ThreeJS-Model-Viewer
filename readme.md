# Ektogamat Three Graces Design Concept using threejs
<h4>by Anderson Mancini</h4>

In this project, I wanted to show that creating a fancy design like this using #threejs is not as difficult as it looks. It has only 240 lines of code. The original design was created by Tom Bogner @dastom on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/6767548-The-Three-Graces-Concept.

This project uses Threejs in vanillaJS with WebPack and is based on my boilerplate: https://github.com/ektogamat/threejs-andy-bolierplate. I think this could be easier to understand for those who isn't familiar with React Three Fiber yet (like myself).
